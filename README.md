# Hockey Analytics

API to retrieve all kind of statistics regarding hockey leagues around the world. This is a project intended to showcase some of my coding abilities, but also to learn new technologies. In fact, this was my first non-tutorial Python project, and the first time I use RabbitMQ. Because it was a project from the ground up, I had the opportunity to test features of Java 8 and Google Guice that I hadn&#39;t the chance to use it the past. For continuous integration, Travis CI was set up for continuous environment, which was also the first time

There are still some bugs, but everything is documented. This is a work in progress.
